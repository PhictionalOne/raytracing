# Raytracing in One Weekend _with Rust_

This Rust project is a implementation of the "Raytracing in One Weekend" tutorial by Peter Shirley. The tutorial serves as a foundational resource for understanding the principles of ray tracing. You can find the tutorial [here](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

## Overview

The project aims to implement a basic ray tracer in Rust, following the principles outlined in the tutorial. It serves as an educational endeavor to grasp the fundamentals of ray tracing and gain proficiency in Rust programming.

## Features

- Basic ray tracing principles as per "Raytracing in One Weekend."
- Utilizes Rust programming language for implementation.

## Learning Objectives

This project serves as a practical exercise to achieve the following learning objectives:

1. **Rust Proficiency:** Strengthen Rust programming skills through the implementation of a ray tracer.
2. **Unit Tests:** Develop and apply unit tests to ensure the correctness of individual components.
3. **Integration Tests:** Implement integration tests to verify the functionality of the complete ray tracing system.
4. **GitHub Actions:** Utilize GitHub Actions for continuous integration to automate testing processes.

## Usage

To generate an image using the ray tracer, run the main application:

```bash
cargo run
```

This will produce the output image based on the implemented ray tracing algorithm.

## Tests

Unit and integration tests are available to ensure the correctness and reliability of the ray tracer. Run the tests using:

```bash
cargo test
```

## Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions is set up to automate the testing process on every push. Check the workflow status in the Actions tab on GitHub.
